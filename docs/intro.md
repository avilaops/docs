# Welcome to Arxis Core

**Arxis** is the most advanced computing infrastructure built in 100% Rust, featuring **120+ interconnected crates** for scientific computing, distributed systems, cryptography, AI/ML, and more.

## 🏛️ The Mathematical Citadel

Arxis represents a comprehensive ecosystem of production-ready tools designed for:

- **🔒 Security-First Development**: Advanced cryptographic primitives including post-quantum cryptography
- **🌐 Distributed Systems**: Raft consensus, gossip protocols, and distributed coordination
- **💾 High-Performance Databases**: Custom storage engines and query optimizers
- **🤖 AI & Machine Learning**: Neural networks, LLMs, and computer vision
- **⚡ Scientific Computing**: Advanced tensor operations, linear algebra, and calculus
- **🎨 Graphics & Visualization**: GPU computing, rendering, and visual analytics

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Add Arxis to your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
avx-core = "0.1.0"
avx-crypto = "0.1.0"
avx-network = "0.1.0"
```

```rust
use avx_core::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Arxis! 🏛️");
}
```
